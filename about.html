			<h2> Artist Bio</h2>
			<p> Angela was born and raised in San Antonio Texas. She achieved her Bachelor's of Fine Art, studio art and a concentration in expanded media at Texas State University in the summer of 2020. Angela's work has been displayed in the Texas State Hallway show for Thesis I. Her work explores different mediums that bridges her concepts. Working with transparent fabrics and reflective surfaces pushes the projection to be displayed in a distorted way. She now continues her Education at Northwest Vista College for an Associate of Applied Science and would be expecting to graduate in the fall of 2022.</p>

			<h3> Artist Statement</h3>
			<p> Thinking back to when I was a little girl I have always been interested in the intersection of my inner world and the outer world. My inner world of imagination, perception, magic and sense of wonder. My outer world of daily life such as school, work, room board, and expenses.
				In my degree of expended media, I utilize digital photography, video, audio, graphic design and illustration. Through this digital medium I explore themes of nature, reflection, distortion of images, light exposure and the senses. When experimenting with materials I can see different reactions that come off of clear materials, glass, plexiglass, CD's, marbles and reflective fabric surfaces that visually bridges the idea and concepts of my art practice. Transparent and reflective material changes the original image into a different image that is being displayed on the wall.
			Through my work I hope to express the idea of using simple materials that may go unnoticed by most people. With presenring light phenomena as a vehicle for self-mediation and reflection. Which would create a space of focus for the viewers that could potentially make a shelter from this hectic world that we all live in.</p>
